\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Prologue}

\begin{block}{Two extreme version of water, too much and too less}
Too much: difficult to stop... it creates floods\newline
Not enough: living beings suffer dehydration\newline

When water is temporally not enough, it impacts plants, 
their production and our food security, 
that is where agricultural water management is important.\newline
\end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Overview}

Agriculture suffers of hazards related to water, too much, too less.\newline
Those are submergence and inadequate amount of water for crop.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Flood events \& the rice submergence risk
 \item Plant and environmental stress
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Flood}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Rice submergence}

MODIS: return several times a day for more than 10 years\newline
Probability of open water leads to understand rice submergence.

\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conclusions}

 Public domain RS data is used for crop risk assessment
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Space monitoring technology in space and time
 \item Landsat8 has 24 hours delivery, high resolution.
\end{enumerate}
