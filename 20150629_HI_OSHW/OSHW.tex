%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Overview}

For agricultural and hazard monitoring, WMO-level accuracy of weather data is not needed. We are introducing a low-cost weather station based on Arduino for extending the National network of the Meteorological Department in Sri Lanka.
